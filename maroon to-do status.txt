To-do:

ASAP:


--when saving multiple rows, try to see if can implement {multiple:true}. This is to add an array to sql, breaking up the array into objects, without using a loop
--https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23266854/node-mysql-multiple-statements-in-one-query
	--for creating multiple sql statements
	implement multiple sql statements true
--make 2 dummy headers, one without search, and without profile & search.
	the one without profile and search should appear on the new doctor page.
	the one without search should appear on dashboard, account details, etc.
-- should be one function to return all account details. Should pull it from multiple sources. The save datas should be different functions, but the fetches should all be bundled up into 1 fcn
	-- will need to make the queried results into a list of objects: [ {}, {}].
-- after saving account data, when navigating back to dashboard, the data hasn't updated. might not be neccesary to update (since the current dashboard is filler)

see papa text:
	-- need to make another table/column in table (maybe in credentials), which is a boolean of wheather or not the vet is verified.
		--vets are verified if their identity is confirmed, and they have their information in (name, hours, etc.)
		-- eventually, will also need to make an option for vets to have an account, but not listed in search (yes/no option in settings or something). would only show their profile to public if this is on.
			-- 2 options: profile shows in search, and profile doesn't show in search (still shows if users directly search for the vet)

-- add personal phone number as a columnt to the credentials table. should be a login method. 
	-- then, query the phone number in personal information, settings.
--consider encrypting user emails. would not change the code besides having to encrypt user input when they enter emails

-- should the new doctor uuid be deleted in db after logout? check all uuid creations, and make sure they're all deleted after logout

--re-do code documentation



Later:


--figure out not putting all routes in app.js. Maybe put the settings routes into the doctorsettings.js

--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
