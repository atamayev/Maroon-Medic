JWT & UUID

Jwt use case: Send jwts just to check if the user is who they say they are
UUID: Used to send pointers to user data (UUID points to a specific ID, which can then be joined on) in json

To-do:
1. start sending uuid as a cookie when logging in instead of others. 
	When data is requested, the UUID cookie will be sent instead of DocID. The UUID is then joined to the DocID, and necessary data is queried and returned in a JSON
	When logging out, will need to clear UUID cookie as well
2. Figure out how to parse and process cookie completely server-side (no more new-vet bs). only this way can it be accessed. make cookie secure and http. 
3.  Implement Make HTTPS
4. 0.5: Figure out a more logial way of naming conventions for routing. what is a user/profile?

5. Editability of doc info

-- after registering, and going back to home, profile doesn't render - requires reload
-- if the doc hasn't entered their basic_doctor_info, then going to their profile is an error - bc it tries to render data that doesn't exist
-- people with existing basic_doctor_info can keep filling out the form. should not be allowed. if data already exists in basic_doctor_info, should be re-routed to /edit-profile
	special cookie sent after logging in, which doesn't allow user to go to registration routes. forwards straight to /edit-profile
-- show first name on home page instead of email. will require decrypt multiple.
