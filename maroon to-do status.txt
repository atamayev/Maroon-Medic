To-do:

ASAP:

-- make a fillHeader function - take type out as a param
	-- works, but make the sql only query the FirstName instead of all fields, will then need to figure out how to deal with the splice in decrypt single
patient dashboard data function. can be same as doctor

1. Patient registration/login
2. Editability of doc info

Later:

-- if pt logged in, or vet logged in, shouldn't be allowed to log into the other one.

-- if the doc hasn't entered their basic_doctor_info, then going to their profile is an error - bc it tries to render data that doesn't exist
-- people with existing basic_doctor_info can keep filling out the form. should not be allowed. if data already exists in basic_doctor_info, should be re-routed to /edit-profile
	special cookie sent after registering, which allows user to go to registration routes. 
	If cookie not present, but UUID is present forwards straight to /edit-profile
	If cookie not present and UUID not present, re-direct to register page

-- doctor "" doesnot exist shows up even for doctors who exist, just don't query (not rly sure how to solve, aside from solving the an error occured issue)

-- show first name on home page instead of email. will require decrypt multiple.
--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

-- figure out saving json data to local storage, and then check if data exists in local storage before quierying db.
