To-do:

ASAP:

- Delete encryption, keep hashes, .
	make sure to label the commit, so that when I come back to it when doing AWS, it's simple to understand how data at rest encryption works
 
-Figure out Doctor_confirmation status (should be 0 until doctor approves, unless instant book is on)

there's a bug when the names of the locations are changed, which cause the times to switch
	if both are titled 123, and the second one is changed to 'availble', the times assigned to them switch
--patient and doctor dashboard should have pending/confirmed appts.
	for doctor, should go onto the calendar

-go through all instances of select dropdowns, and make the 'select' options disabled

Make the 'Add Address' Button Finalize a Location, make it within the accordion. 
	So when add address is pressed, it becomes a pretty-looking text (can edit it by pressing a pencil in the top right or something)
	Add a new 'Add new address' button to add a new acordion strip

Write documentation, especially for saveAddresses

go through all if, else if, else, and if it's a one-liner, delete the {}, and make it on the same line

Add a section in doctordetails for wheather or not the doc works for a practice/company (will neeed to create a lookup and mapping table for vet companies as options)

-- will likely need to simplify the select.js. what it's doing rn is redundant. inside account details, it's setting the value of the type of to the id. then, select has to find which type has that id.
	for example, if select Lemonade insurance, instead of setting selected vet school to Lemondae, it first sends back lemonad'es id, and then converts it to the name
simplification of pre-vet education needed.

Later:

Calendar
- when registering as a patient, need to make it clear when the user is entering data regrading the human, and when about the pet

-Add an admin user type (manages/can see multiple doctor's activities)

-Add an Administrator user Type (God-mode, for me to log into any account in a read-only mode)
	assume someone's personality, not able to edit (read only)

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/

-- consider adding a verified column to the Credentials table (verify for both pts and docs) - not sure how to verify pts, would be a steep onboarding

start using bootstrap or integrate tailwind css classes. tell chatgpt to make pages prettier (header, etc.)

figure out phone_priority (address_data), currently sending it back as 0. Phone priority is for when one location has multiple phone numbers. So each object in the address list might have an object inside that contains phone numbers, link
	See 5/19 commit
	
after vet/prevet education queries from db, it doesn't show the month name, but the numerical representation of the month (instead of January, shows 1).

-allow for entering multiple degrees from one college (without causing the education table to break (because of the constraint))

inactivity logout ( 5 mins). implement on the verification level (in the jwt)

-- before saving email to db, make sure it is lowercase, so that when searching db, it is done in uniform way
	save emails as lowercase. then, when logging in, email should be lowercased before searching the db.
	-- figure out which data should be encrypted by the db. data at rest encryption
