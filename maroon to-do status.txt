To-do:

ASAP:

see papa text:
	-- need to make another table/column in table (maybe in credentials), which is a boolean of wheather or not the vet is verified.
		--vets are verified if their identity is confirmed, and they have their information in (name, hours, etc.)
		-- eventually, will also need to make an option for vets to have an account, but not listed in search (yes/no option in settings or something). would only show their profile to public if this is on.
			-- 2 options: profile shows in search, and profile doesn't show in search (still shows if users directly search for the vet)

-- should the new doctor uuid be deleted in db after logout? check all uuid creations, and make sure they're all deleted after logout
	both doc and pt

-- consider funneleing all lists through one route. schools majors, etc. Same as account details.
	--would still be necessary to keep some of the list routes seperate (like languages - since those can be searched over, and patients should be allowed to add their languages).
	

--re-do code documentation



Later:

--make 2 dummy headers, one without search, and without profile & search.
	the one without profile and search should appear on the new doctor page.
	the one without search should appear on dashboard, account details, etc.
	
--figure out not putting all routes in app.js. Maybe put the settings routes into the doctorsettings.js

--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
