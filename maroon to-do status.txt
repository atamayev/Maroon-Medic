To-do:

ASAP:
create new functoin: need to figure out how to save prices along with time for each service. 

1. Address + phone numbers

-- will likely need to simplify the select.js. what it's doing rn is redundant. inside account details, it's setting the value of the type of to the id. then, select has to find which type has that id.
	for example, if select Lemonade insurance, instead of setting selected vet school to Lemondae, it first sends back lemonad'es id, and then converts it to the name
simplification of pre-vet education needed.
general simplification of account details needed.

-- before saving email to db, make sure it is lowercase, so that when searching db, it is done in uniform way
	save emails as lowercase. then, when logging in, email should be lowercased before searching the db.
	-- figure out which data should be encrypted by the db. data at rest encryption

Later:

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/

--figure out not putting all routes in app.js. Maybe put the settings routes into the doctorsettings.js

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
-- consider adding a verified row to patient_credneitals

start using bootstrap or integrate tailwind css classes. tell chatgpt to make pages prettier (header, etc.)
