To-do:

ASAP:

PatientDashboard:
	1. Should only query upcoming appointments if there are upcoming appts
	2. Should not just query the first appt from DB, but all of them (array of objects), and then display that properly on teh screen
	3. Seperate by upcoming and past appts
	4. Need to figure out when to ask the DB for the patientData (after an appointment is scheduled, dashboard data not refreshed.) also, if doctor approves an appt while pt logged in, session storage doesn't get reset.
DoctorDashboard:
	1. Add pending and confirmed appts to calendar (different colors)
	2.Aprove appointments from the dashbboard--> sets confirmation_status to 1.

-go through all instances of select dropdowns, and make the 'select' options disabled

-instead of re-rendering pateint dashboard each time, maybe there's a way to set the dashborad data from the back-end.

-fix issue where,if no times are seleected, locations don't render.

there's a bug when the names of the locations are changed, which cause the times to switch
	if both are titled 123, and the second one is changed to 'availble', the times assigned to them switch


Make the 'Add Address' Button Finalize a Location, make it within the accordion. 
	So when add address is pressed, it becomes a pretty-looking text (can edit it by pressing a pencil in the top right or something)
	Add a new 'Add new address' button to add a new acordion strip

Write documentation, especially for saveAddresses


Add a section in doctordetails for wheather or not the doc works for a practice/company (will neeed to create a lookup and mapping table for vet companies as options)

-- will likely need to simplify the select.js. what it's doing rn is redundant. inside account details, it's setting the value of the type of to the id. then, select has to find which type has that id.
	for example, if select Lemonade insurance, instead of setting selected vet school to Lemondae, it first sends back lemonad'es id, and then converts it to the name
simplification of pre-vet education needed.

Later:

Calendar
- when registering as a patient, need to make it clear when the user is entering data regrading the human, and when about the pet
Do the calculations for the next appointment dates on the back-end. Will need to figure out which dates/times area unavailable due to conflicting appointments.
	Also, due to the detailed_booking_availblity fields (how far in advance to book, etc.)
-Add an admin user type (manages/can see multiple doctor's activities)

-Add an Administrator user Type (God-mode, for me to log into any account in a read-only mode)
	assume someone's personality, not able to edit (read only)

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/

-- consider adding a verified column to the Credentials table (verify for both pts and docs) - not sure how to verify pts, would be a steep onboarding

start using bootstrap or integrate tailwind css classes. tell chatgpt to make pages prettier (header, etc.)

figure out phone_priority (address_data), currently sending it back as 0. Phone priority is for when one location has multiple phone numbers. So each object in the address list might have an object inside that contains phone numbers, link
	See 5/19 commit
-consider bringing back selecting the entire category in vet services

-allow for entering multiple degrees from one college (without causing the education table to break (because of the constraint))

inactivity logout ( 5 mins). implement on the verification level (in the jwt)
