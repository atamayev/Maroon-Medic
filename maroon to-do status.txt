To-do:

ASAP:
-add a front-end 'saved' to the personal-infromation page
-during registration, make the years reversed, from 1930
in personal information, amke birthmonth, day, year, gender into dropdowns

- go through all of the save.js functions, and see which of them rely on the status being true. for the ones that don't require true, delete returning true/false from the endpoint

-figure out how to choose a certain date instead of a day of week
-create a bookings table, which has foreign keys of doctor_Id, patient_ID, service_name, location_ID, time, day
there's a bug when the names of the locations are changed, which cause the times to switch
	if both are titled 123, and the second one is changed to 'availble', the times assigned to them switch
	
Make the 'Add Address' Button Finalize a Location, make it within the accordion. 
	So when add address is pressed, it becomes a pretty-looking text (can edit it by pressing a pencil in the top right or something)
	Add a new 'Add new address' button to add a new acordion strip
-figure out how to save public doctor data, if that is even necessary
Write documentation, especially for saveAddresses

Add a section in doctordetails for wheather or not the doc works for a practice/company (will neeed to create a lookup and mapping table for vet companies as options)

-- will likely need to simplify the select.js. what it's doing rn is redundant. inside account details, it's setting the value of the type of to the id. then, select has to find which type has that id.
	for example, if select Lemonade insurance, instead of setting selected vet school to Lemondae, it first sends back lemonad'es id, and then converts it to the name
simplification of pre-vet education needed.
general simplification of account details needed.

-- before saving email to db, make sure it is lowercase, so that when searching db, it is done in uniform way
	save emails as lowercase. then, when logging in, email should be lowercased before searching the db.
	-- figure out which data should be encrypted by the db. data at rest encryption

-when login/register, make a show password button

Later:
Calendar

Encrypt address and phone number entry to the DB

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
-- consider adding a verified row to patient_credneitals

start using bootstrap or integrate tailwind css classes. tell chatgpt to make pages prettier (header, etc.)

figure out phone_priority (address_data), currently sending it back as 0. Phone priority is for when one location has multiple phone numbers. So each object in the address list might have an object inside that contains phone numbers, link
	See 5/19 commit
	
after vet/prevet education queries from db, it doesn't show the month name, but the numerical representation of the month (instead of January, shows 1).
