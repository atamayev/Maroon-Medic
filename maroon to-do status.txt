To-do:

4. 0.5: Figure out a more logial way of naming conventions for routing. what is a user/profile?
4. Fix Contexts in dashboard, header. Could be giving problems bc dashboard data takes a while to fill (observe backend console)
5. Editability of doc info


-- if the doc hasn't entered their basic_doctor_info, then going to their profile is an error - bc it tries to render data that doesn't exist
-- people with existing basic_doctor_info can keep filling out the form. should not be allowed. if data already exists in basic_doctor_info, should be re-routed to /edit-profile
	special cookie sent after registering, which allows user to go to registration routes. 
	If cookie not present, but UUID is present forwards straight to /edit-profile
	If cookie not present and UUID not present, re-direct to register page

--figure out why there are 2 doctorUUID to DoctorID functions (user CTRL, UUID)

-- doctor "" doesnot exist shows up even for doctors who exist, just don't query (not rly sure how to solve, aside from solving the an error occured issue)

-- show first name on home page instead of email. will require decrypt multiple.
--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

--make one login/register function for vet/pt. Pass in a third parameter (vet vs pt).
	if vet--> use the vetdb
	if pt--> use the ptdb

--any react components that have multiple functions in useEffects should have multiple useEffects (unless their dependencies are the same - ie both wwatching cookie monster).
	useEffect watches for something to change.
	add dependencies to any useEffects that might need them.

-- replace all instances of cookies with a global cookie monster variable. 

-- when someone makes a search query, it should appear on the serach bar when they go to the next page.
	-- consider make a new local storage object - previus saerch. when someone makes a search, it should become similar to the value in the serach bar. but should be changable obvisouly

--in checkdoctorUUID, should search the DB for the found UUID.

-- header still doesn't checkdoctoruuid correctly
