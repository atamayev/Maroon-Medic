To-do:

ASAP:
combine add/delete into a select for insruances, services. should be straightforward

make sure services only save if time filled in

need to figure out how to display saved service data
make setmonth, year, startmonth, year, etc. into a single state (Education)


Make the 'Add Address' Button Finalize a Location, make it within the accordion. 
	So when add address is pressed, it becomes a pretty-looking text (can edit it by pressing a pencil in the top right or something)
	Add a new 'Add new address' button to add a new acordion strip
Encrypt address and phone number entry to the DB

-- will likely need to simplify the select.js. what it's doing rn is redundant. inside account details, it's setting the value of the type of to the id. then, select has to find which type has that id.
	for example, if select Lemonade insurance, instead of setting selected vet school to Lemondae, it first sends back lemonad'es id, and then converts it to the name
simplification of pre-vet education needed.
general simplification of account details needed.

-- before saving email to db, make sure it is lowercase, so that when searching db, it is done in uniform way
	save emails as lowercase. then, when logging in, email should be lowercased before searching the db.
	-- figure out which data should be encrypted by the db. data at rest encryption


Later:

Figure out pictures

Calendar

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
-- consider adding a verified row to patient_credneitals

start using bootstrap or integrate tailwind css classes. tell chatgpt to make pages prettier (header, etc.)

figure out phone_priority (address_data), currently sending it back as 0. Phone priority is for when one location has multiple phone numbers. So each object in the address list might have an object inside that contains phone numbers, link
