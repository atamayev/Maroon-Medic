To-do:

ASAP:

-- should the new doctor uuid be deleted in db after logout? check all uuid creations, and make sure they're all deleted after logout
	both doc and pt

--fill in the schools sql table.

--re-do code documentation



Later:

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/
	
--make 2 dummy headers, one without search, and without profile & search.
	the one without profile and search should appear on the new doctor page.
	the one without search should appear on dashboard, account details, etc.
	
--figure out not putting all routes in app.js. Maybe put the settings routes into the doctorsettings.js

--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
