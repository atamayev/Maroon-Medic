To-do:

ASAP:

--create one save function for all of similar sql tables (insurances, langauges, etc. can all be in one function, template literals the reest)

-- need to create save speciality data function, and the cascading dropdown.

-- before saving email to db, make sure it is lowercase, so that when searching db, it is done in uniform way
	save emails as lowercase. then, when logging in, email should be lowercased before searching the db.
	-- figure out which data should be encrypted by the db. data at rest encryption

--make sure the list and doctor account data mathc up numbers (first one one both should be same)
	the indeces of each type of category should be the same (ie specialiteis should have hte same number for both)

fill in the rest of list details
	--checkbox integratoin vs dropdown. for insruances, checkbox. see email for details: "Fill in rest of lists"

--fill in the schools sql table.


Later:

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/
	
--make 2 dummy headers, one without search, and without profile & search.
	the one without profile and search should appear on the new doctor page.
	the one without search should appear on dashboard, account details, etc.
	
--figure out not putting all routes in app.js. Maybe put the settings routes into the doctorsettings.js

--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
-- consider adding a verified row to patient_credneitals
