To-do:

ASAP:

-- nEW-DOCTOR PAGE: people with existing basic_doctor_info can keep filling out the form. should not be allowed. if data already exists in basic_doctor_info, should be re-routed to /edit-profile
	special cookie sent after registering, which allows user to go to registration routes. 
	If cookie not present, but UUID is present forwards straight to /edit-profile
	If cookie not present and UUID not present, re-direct to register page
See github desktop
	
--re-do code documentation


Later:

see papa text:
	-- need to make another table/column in table (maybe in credentials), which is a boolean of wheather or not the vet is verified.
		--vets are verified if their identity is confirmed, and they have their information in (name, hours, etc.)
		-- eventually, will also need to make an option for vets to have an account, but not listed in search (yes/no option in settings or something). would only show their profile to public if this is on.
			-- 2 options: profile shows in search, and profile doesn't show in search (still shows if users directly search for the vet)
		
		
--figure out not putting all routes in app.js. Maybe put the settings routes into the doctorsettings.js

--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

figure out what to do when user not verified in the doctor/patient pages. can't just log unverified
