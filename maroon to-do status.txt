To-do:

1. Review in detail dependencies of all wrap functions. They are called whenever anything changes when dependency is blank. search term, location, etc.
	- might not need a useEffect for wraps (look how verify/uuid does it)
	--will need to figure out how to only call the function when a specific link changes CHATGPT HAD SOMETHING


--delete location as a dependency, asap. all of the useEffects are called whenever a link changes. this is dumb

-- also, fetchData is run whenever hte search term is changed. seems to be at every page.
-- console.log('something') in every single useEffect to see how often it is run. this could be a disaster if everything is running
-- figure out how to get fetchUsers to run only if the page is home/specific home
--how does doctor.js load when linked to from home, but home isn't rendered when linked to.
	double query is back - location dependency is being annoying
	-- also delete cookie monster as a dependency for most useEffects.
-- if link  ==patient register, &&patient UUID==true, navigate. 
	import cookie monster as a dependency

-- if search has no results, site crashes. this is because of the asynchronus nature of the find function. see chatgpt for details

-- for all the patient/doctor singular functons, if not doctor or not patient, make an else that returns an error
--make verify tokens different for doctor/patient

1. Patient registration/login
2. Editability of doc info
ASAP:

-- make a fillHeader function, make private patient data routes, 
patient dashboard data function. can be same as doctor

--make uuid to id a context. will need to pull this in multiple places. 


Later:

-- if pt logged in, or vet logged in, shouldn't be allowed to log into the other one.

-- if the doc hasn't entered their basic_doctor_info, then going to their profile is an error - bc it tries to render data that doesn't exist
-- people with existing basic_doctor_info can keep filling out the form. should not be allowed. if data already exists in basic_doctor_info, should be re-routed to /edit-profile
	special cookie sent after registering, which allows user to go to registration routes. 
	If cookie not present, but UUID is present forwards straight to /edit-profile
	If cookie not present and UUID not present, re-direct to register page

-- doctor "" doesnot exist shows up even for doctors who exist, just don't query (not rly sure how to solve, aside from solving the an error occured issue)

-- show first name on home page instead of email. will require decrypt multiple.
--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

--in checkdoctorUUID, should search the DB for the found UUID.

--searching null or undefined shouldn't query all results
