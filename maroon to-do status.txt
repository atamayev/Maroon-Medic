To-do:

4. 0.5: Figure out a more logial way of naming conventions for routing. what is a user/profile?
4. Fix Contexts in dashboard, header. Could be giving problems bc dashboard data takes a while to fill (observe backend console)
5. Editability of doc info


-- if the doc hasn't entered their basic_doctor_info, then going to their profile is an error - bc it tries to render data that doesn't exist
-- people with existing basic_doctor_info can keep filling out the form. should not be allowed. if data already exists in basic_doctor_info, should be re-routed to /edit-profile
	special cookie sent after registering, which allows user to go to registration routes. 
	If cookie not present, but UUID is present forwards straight to /edit-profile
	If cookie not present and UUID not present, re-direct to register page

--figure out why there are 2 doctorUUID to DoctorID functions (user CTRL, UUID)

--create contexts. there should be one context for results
	--fix verify function context in header and dashboard.
		1. When navigating to dashboard, new-vet, edit-profile (don't need to verify when saving (already veryfying when navigating, don't need double verificaiton).
	-- verificiation doesn't work in new-vet either. fixed it for now by bringing back old fcn
	--header.js context. await doesn't work

-- doctor "" doesnot exist shows up even for doctors who exist, just don't query (not rly sure how to solve, aside from solving the an error occured issue)

-- show first name on home page instead of email. will require decrypt multiple.
--create another header. one for home screen. one for vet screen (no search bar, just calendar, inbox button (chat), settings (make header like airbnb)
	--hide search bar in the vet pages (see app.js)	

--make one login/register function for vet/pt. Pass in a third parameter (vet vs pt).
	if vet--> use the vetdb
	if pt--> use the ptdb

--only wrap doctor context provider around things that need it (only functions that are UUID)

--onclick button header
	onclick button doesn't work bc search term isn't being imported

-- instead of navigate to dashbord after login, make it go to the dashboard (instead of Link to, make it an Href, so that the data re-quieres

--any react components that have multiple functions in useEffects should have multiple useEffects (unless their dependencies are the same - ie both wwatching cookie monster).
	useEffect watches for something to change.
	add dependencies to any useEffects that might need them.

-- replace all instances of cookies with a global cookie monster variable. 

--when searching for specific term, doesn't let you change the search parameter
