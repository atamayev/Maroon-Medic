To-do:

Doctor dashboard edits
	Each unapproved appointment should be an accordion. when click, should open more details, and have approve/deny appointment options
	Order the appointments by their date.
	Make a filter to filter approved or unapproved appointments 

Fix the types on the vet education, prevet education in fetch public doctor data db
	they do not contain the mapping id, and a new type should be created specifically for the public data.
	go through the other public doctor data types, and see if they just use the private doctor types. make sure the fields match up.
	fix in front-end as well.

Make the naming of the types in the front/backend match up better

Maroon --> Mane Transition

-setup postman to make making requests easier.
	add the Doctor/Patient UUID as a cookie, and hit the endpoint directly
		or, make the UUID be a header (ie authorizatoin header) whenever sending a req back and forth
			don't make it doctorUUID or patientUUID, just make it UUID. same for AccessToken
			think about the best way to structure the acess token/ uuid thing

On the My-Pets page, make each pet have it's own 'row' card, similar to addersses in doctor account details (shouldn't be able to close/open, always open)
	show something like the picture on the left side, and then the details on the right. Details can include past appointments, other stuff (can always add later)

-mini bug when making a booking. make a booking with `changes in behavior`. The time is 10 AM- 10AM (it's a full day appointment). Should say something like (10AM (july 17) - 10AM (july 18))

-start figuring out only being able to make appointments during available time slots (shouldn't be able to book an appointment while that time slot is booked)

-think about how isActive should work - what actually happens when a user deletes their account. should a new user be allowed to make an account with that same email instantaneosly?

make the phone number input in the location.js only accept numbers (Phone input)

-duplicate entries need to be accounted for when added to DB. Unique constraints. when the same data is entered into the pre_vet_edcatinn_mapping table, it gives an error, but doesn't enter the data.
	Make the error on the front-end be say something like: duplicate entry. Or, don't allow the user to add the same entry twice
	Do this for all tables

--change all front-end select month, day, year into a "date", like in pets.js
	-make the date only be sometime in the past

- when registering as a patient, need to make it clear when the user is entering data regrading the human, and when about the pet

-Reviews:
	Patient's able to make a review after the appointment date is completed, given that the appointment is approved by the doctor.

On the vet dashboard, make the appointments clickable, shows the patients details, pet details, etc.
	Should go to a newly created appointment page, which nicely lays out the appointment details.
	If that event is clicked on from calendar view, it should go to that link as well

- go through DoctorDashboard Layout txt file

LATER:

-Delete momentjs from front-end. figure out the dayjs conversion problem in the select-time.tsx.

-figure out IP Address situation (for the login and security page). Also see if can figure out what kind of device the user has

Make the "Add Address" Button Finalize a Location, make it within the accordion.
	So when add address is pressed, it becomes a pretty-looking text (can edit it by pressing a pencil in the top right or something)
	Add a new "Add new address" button to add a new acordion strip
	Won't need a save button. the add/delete buttons will act as saves. will need to make the delete button double confirmation like everything else

Add a section in doctordetails for wheather or not the doc works for a practice/company (will neeed to create a lookup and mapping table for vet companies as options)

Do the calculations for the next appointment dates on the back-end. Will need to figure out which dates/times area unavailable due to conflicting appointments.
	Also, due to the detailed_booking_availblity fields (how far in advance to book, etc.)

-Add an admin user type (manages/can see multiple doctor's activities)

-Add an Administrator user Type (God-mode, for me to log into any account in a read-only mode)
	assume someone's personality, not able to edit (read only)

--while loading, dashboard, account details should be like this:
	https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/placeholder/

-- consider adding a verified column to the Credentials table (verify for both pts and docs) - not sure how to verify pts, would be a steep onboarding

-allow for entering multiple degrees from one college (without causing the education table to break (because of the constraint))

inactivity logout ( 5 mins). implement on the verification level (in the jwt)

-I think the real selling point for pts to use the platform is knowing ahead of time if their insurance provider will cover a certain service. Will either require a lot of research, or data searching.
	Ask Phil if insurances openly disclose what they will/won't cover for which type of pets.
	Figure out a way to make it really user for users to figure out if their insurance covers a certain procedure.

-make entering time data into location.js easier. currently a pain in the ass, keeps reseting

-Look deeply at the SQL table operations. see if it's worth de-normalizing any of the tables to increase performance.
	For example, the Doctor_ID didn't used to be in the Appointments table. The address ID was joined from the addresses table, and the DoctorID was extracted from there.
	Even though that is normalized (not duplicating Doctor ID twice), it leads to performance problems, since the enter addresses table is joined with appointments, just to retrieve the DoctorID
	Check for any other SQL operations which perform heavy joins that could have an efficiency boost from de-normalizing data

-Implement scrollSpy into Account Details, other components to make scrolling through various sections easier

-Allow for entering a decimal place service price (while typing). Permit the user to enter 10.50 instead of 1050, and then a . between 10 and 50.
